# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The reason for the Prework study guide webpage was to be the founding blocking on learning how to code. This project was built so that I could keep notes and continue to practice and apply the information I am learning through out this boot camp. It is to have a place I can quickly reference any notes I may need for HTML, CSS, Git, Java.
